#Hill Climbinbg Using Hand Gestures

I have created an application for hand gesture recognition in a game using hand recognition technology. The software allows the game to be controlled using hand gestures, making it possible to execute all in-game actions simply by moving your hands. The application was designed by creating a set of data and instructions that are triggered by specific hand movements, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game with a more intuitive and natural control system.
